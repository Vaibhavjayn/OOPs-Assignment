    "Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",

    "Ans. class in OOPs is the concept of defining a class with use \"class\" keyword already defined in python or we can say a built-in keyword where we perform and define such functions(methods in class) and also specify attributes or data in it to be used to fully develop a class structure. It is a vital block which is helpful in usage of same code further again in any other class or code in same program i.e it is a reusable code that is not necessarily required to be built from start we just need to call it with different instances to perform certain tasks that are specified under the class."

    "Ans. Abstraction is used to make our class abstract i.e if we are not willing to show or define the working of our class then we can hide its working on background and can show the main important or required information . As to achieve abstraction we use, \" @abstractmethod \" before each and every method defined in the class which we want to get abstracted, also the abstract methods of class can't be given any return statement inside them and also their will be no instance or object can be created for abstract class, thus we can inherit only the class but no object can be created for that class.\n",
    " Whereas, Encapsulation means binding with the class i.e the attributes or data values we specified under the __init__ method of class will be binded with their usage to the class only, they can't be accessed or used by any other class. Therefore, \n",

    "__init__ method which is also refered to initialize the attributes of class in starting, hence this helps to already define what numbers of parameters or arguments we are having and where they will be stored , this is the method which will be called automatically when any object of class will be created. Another method is __new__ method which shows the or can be understood as class method and consist cls in its paranthesis and when both __init__ and __new__ method is defined in any class then the __new__ method will be called only and no __init__ method will run. Also there is more such methods like __add__ , specifically when there is any method in  __(method name)__ , this format then it shows that the method is dunder method and these methods are not required to call as they are automatically called while creation of an object of the class."

    "Ans. Inheritance in Python is as simple by its name, we can understand easily that the attributes, properties and methods that are already in base or parent class can be accessed by their child class too only if they are inheriting their parent class, the inheritance is as simple as in our normal life where we can simply understand it as that the properties of parent class are accessible to child class but the property of child class can't be accessed or inherited by parent class. This helps in reducing line of codes and we can simply use already defined property of a class in other class by simply calling it after inheritance of the class. Inheritance in Python is achieved by five ways:-\n",

    "(ii) Method Overriding\n",
    "Here, In Python, Method overloading is not supported in its true manner as it is not done by taking different values or arguments with same method name and it will not run in Python like this manner, Here in python we can achieve this by using Default Arguments and Variable Length Arguments easily but not completely in true sense.\n",
    "Also Method overloading can be done within the same class whereas method overriding is done between 2 or more classes. Here, we can easily do method overriding process as in inheritance when we define method name of parent and child class as by same name then the child class is so powerful that it can easily override the parent method and can return output according to its own."

    "Ans. Encapsulation means hiding something, or bundling of data and methods of a class. Encapsulation is done in order to make our any sensitive information attribute safe or the data, methods we want to make non sharable or accessible for others is done by performing encapsulation. \n",
    "Here, Encapsulation is done using three ways:-\n",

Private: - This is the method to save our information or data of class only accessible by its own class only and no other third person can access or modify information in it, they are only accessed under their own class means if any class inheriting the class with private methods and attributes still not able to see or use the attributes or data of their base(parent) class. This make our highly sensitive information safer and unchangeable. Here put double underscore, __ before the attribure or method you want to make private.\n",
    "3. Protected: - This is also the method used to protect our methods and variables of class but they can be accessed within the both class and in its subclass, here we use single underscore, _ before the method or variable(attribute) we want to make protected.  "

These methods are defind using @classmethod decorator. Instead of self, we will directly use cls as first parameter. Also classmethod can be called directly without creating any instance, and they also used to override __init__ method's value or attributes. \n",
    "Whereas, Static methods are those methods that behaves like a simple method which can be simply called using classname with method name and here also, not required to make any instance of class to call the methods defined in class. They do not required to use self or cls."

Abstract classes are created using the \"abc\" module i.e Abstract Base Classes. They can contain abstract methods which are declared but can't be implemented in the abstract class. Subclasses or child classes are then required to provide implementations for these abstract methods. Abstract class is also useful in hiding complex implimentation, hiding unnecessary details and exposing only required that's why these classes can't be instantiated.  "

We can encapsulate data and methods i.e bundling them within a class, hiding internal implementation details and protecting data from unauthorized access. Also there we perform other tasks like Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction. "

    "Ans. super() function helps in accessing the data attributes of super class i.e base class or parent class in the child class as with super() we can directly access any attribute or data initialized in the parent class to the child class easily. Also similarly, it works for calling any method of parent class as super() returns a proxy object that represents the parent class. It allows you to call methods from a superclass without explicitly naming it."

It can be called directly by using class name with method name , this behaves like a plin function that only belongs to class, it doesn't either take self or cls. \n",
    "Whereas, @classmethod is that method that refers to the method that is belongs to class only and also they do not require any instance to be used for their calling, they can be just simply called with class name and then the class method name. Also, they use cls in place of self that means that they are refering to the class itself."

Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" In Python, it refers to the ability to use a single interface (like a method or function name) to represent different underlying forms (data types or classes).Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming, and in Python, it works very naturally — especially when using inheritance.It works on Method Overriding with using Inheritance.
